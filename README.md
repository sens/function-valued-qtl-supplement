# Supplementary information "A flexible estimating equations approach for mapping function-valued traits"

In this page we share supplementary information related to our work on
mapping function-valued traits. The computer programs were written by
Hao Xiong and Saunak Sen.

Function-valued traits are traits that are better considered as curves
or functions. Examples include developmental trajectories, and
circadian activity patterns. Our work was motivated by mouse circadian
data that we are also distributing.

Inside the `programs` directory are two subdirectories called `py` and
`R` which contain the Python and R code respectively. The subdirectory
called `data` has the mouse genotype and phenotype data.
